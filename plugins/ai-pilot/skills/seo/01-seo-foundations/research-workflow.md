# Research-First Workflow

**MANDATORY: Always research before implementing SEO/GEO strategies.**

## 4-Step Research Process

### Step 1: Verify Guidelines (5 min)

Before ANY recommendation, check current official sources:

```bash
# Google Official
- Google Search Central (developers.google.com/search)
- Quality Rater Guidelines (latest PDF)
- Google Search Status Dashboard

# Schema.org
- schema.org (check version 16.0+)
- Structured Data Testing Tool

# Platform-Specific
- Meta for Developers (OG tags)
- Twitter Developer Docs (Cards)
- LinkedIn Marketing Docs
```

### Step 2: SERP Analysis (10 min)

Analyze current top 10 results for target keyword:

```markdown
| Rank | URL | Title Length | Meta Desc | Schema | AI Overview? |
|------|-----|--------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1    |     |              |           |        |             |
```

**Check for:**
- AI Overview presence (16% of queries in 2026)
- Featured snippet format
- People Also Ask (PAA) questions
- Schema types used by top 3
- Content length (median)
- E-E-A-T signals (author, sources)

### Step 3: AI Platform Testing (15 min)

Test keyword in ALL major platforms:

```bash
1. ChatGPT: "Tell me about [keyword]"
2. Google AI Overview: Search on Google
3. Perplexity: "[keyword] latest information"
4. Gemini: "[keyword] comprehensive guide"
5. Copilot: "[keyword] recommendations"
```

**Document:**
- Which sources are cited?
- What format do AI prefer? (lists, definitions, steps)
- Are competitors mentioned?
- What's missing that you could provide?

### Step 4: Tool Verification (5 min)

Verify recommended tools are:
- Still active in 2026
- Updated recently (check changelog)
- Compatible with current standards

```bash
# Traditional SEO
✅ Ahrefs (check API v4)
✅ SEMrush (verify license)
✅ Screaming Frog (v19+)

# GEO Tracking
✅ OmniSEO® (Share of Model tracking)
✅ Otterly.ai (multi-platform monitoring)
✅ Rankscale (AI visibility score)
```
