# Share of Model (SoM)

**Measuring your brand's AI citation percentage.**

## Formula

```
Share of Model = (Your Citations / Total Citations) × 100
```

---

## Example Calculation

```bash
Query: "best SEO tools 2026"

AI mentions:
- Ahrefs: 8 times
- SEMrush: 6 times
- Moz: 4 times
- Your Tool: 2 times
Total: 20 mentions

Your SoM = (2 / 20) × 100 = 10%
```

## Benchmarks 2026

| Industry | Average SoM | Top Player SoM |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| SEO Tools | 15% | 35% (Ahrefs) |
| CRM | 12% | 40% (Salesforce) |
| E-commerce | 8% | 25% (Shopify) |
