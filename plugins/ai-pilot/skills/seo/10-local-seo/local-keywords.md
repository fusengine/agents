# Local Keywords and Geo-Targeting (2026)

**Optimization for geo-localized and "near me" searches.**

## Types of Local Keywords

### 1. Explicit Geo-Modified

```text
[service] + [city]
[service] + [neighborhood]
[service] + [zip code]

Examples:
- "plumber manhattan"
- "dentist upper east side"
- "italian restaurant 10001"
```

### 2. Implicit Geo-Modified

```text
[service] + "near me"
[service] + "nearby"

Examples:
- "pizza near me"
- "auto shop nearby"
- "pharmacy open now"
```

### 3. Local Searches Without Modifier

```text
Google detects local intent via:
- Search history
- GPS location
- Query type (restaurant, barber...)

Examples detected as local:
- "italian restaurant" (from NYC)
- "emergency plumber"
- "open sunday"
```

## Local Keyword Research

### Method 1: Google Autocomplete

```text
Type in Google:
"plumber new york" → see suggestions
"plumber new york m" → see neighborhoods
"plumber new york emergency" → see variations

Document ALL suggestions
```

### Method 2: "People Also Ask"

```text
Search "[service] [city]"
Collect PAA questions:
- "What is the best plumber in NYC?"
- "How much does a plumber cost in Manhattan?"
- "24 hour plumber NYC?"
```

### Method 3: Google Keyword Planner

```text
1. Ads.google.com > Keyword Planner
2. Set location (e.g., New York, 50mi)
3. Enter base keywords
4. Filter by local volume
5. Export suggestions
```

### Method 4: Competitive Analysis

```text
Analyze well-ranking competitors:
✅ Their local page titles
✅ GBP categories
✅ Review content (Place Topics)
✅ Keywords in review responses
```

### Method 5: Community Sources

```text
✅ Customer vocabulary
✅ Phone questions asked
✅ Google reviews (recurring words)
✅ Local forums
✅ Local Facebook groups
✅ Local Reddit (r/nyc, etc.)
```

## Local Search Volume

### Tool Limitations

```text
⚠️ Tools often give national volumes
⚠️ Actual local volumes often underestimated
⚠️ "Near me" is hard to measure
```

### Local Volume Estimation

```text
Approximate formula:
Local volume ≈ National volume × (City population / National population) × 1.5

Example:
"plumber" national = 90,000/month
NYC = 8.3M / 330M = 2.5%
NYC volume ≈ 90,000 × 2.5% × 1.5 ≈ 3,375/month
```

### Focus on Intent, Not Volume

```text
✅ Local keywords = strong intent
✅ Higher conversion than generic keywords
✅ Even low volume = profitable
```

## "Near Me" Optimization

### Key 2026 Statistics

- **76%** visit a business within 24 hours
- **28%** result in a purchase
- Continued year-over-year growth
- Dominated by **mobile** (>80%)

### "Near Me" Ranking Factors

```text
1. Physical proximity (GPS)
2. GBP profile relevance
3. Prominence (reviews, authority)
4. Business hours (currently open)
5. Mobile-friendliness of site
```

### Specific Optimization

```text
✅ 100% optimized GBP (categories, attributes)
✅ Visible physical address (not hidden)
✅ Updated hours (including holidays)
✅ Recent and numerous photos
✅ Recent reviews with keywords
✅ Responsive + fast site
✅ LocalBusiness Schema with coordinates
```

### Should You Use "Near Me" in Content?

```text
❌ Not necessary in content
✅ Google understands intent via GBP + location
✅ Focus on [service] + [city/neighborhood]
✅ Natural variations: "nearby", "in your area"
```
