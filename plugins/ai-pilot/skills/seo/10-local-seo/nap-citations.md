# NAP Citations - Consistency and Management

**NAP = Name, Address, Phone. Foundation of local SEO.**

## Why NAP Consistency is Critical

- Google uses citations to **verify legitimacy**
- Inconsistencies = mixed signals = **ranking drop**
- Direct impact on **Local Pack** and **Google Maps**
- Essential for **voice search** ("Ok Google, pizza near me")

## Standardized NAP Format

### Golden Rule: IDENTICAL everywhere

```text
✅ Correct:
   Name: ABC Plumbing
   Address: 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001
   Phone: (212) 555-1234

❌ Incorrect (variations):
   Name: ABC Plumbing LLC / A.B.C. Plumbing / ABC-Plumbing
   Address: 123 main st / 123 Main St. / 123, Main Street
   Phone: 2125551234 / +1 212 555 1234 / 212.555.1234
```

### Standardization Checklist

| Element | Decision to Make |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | With or without legal form (LLC, Inc) |
| **Street** | "Street" or "St." - choose ONE format |
| **State** | Full name or abbreviation |
| **Phone** | Format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX |
| **Website** | With or without www, with or without trailing / |

## NAP Audit Process

### Step 1: Document Official NAP

```markdown
## Official NAP (source: GBP)
- Name: [exactly as on GBP]
- Address: [exactly as on GBP]
- Phone: [exactly as on GBP]
- Website: [canonical URL]
```

### Step 2: Scan Existing Citations

**Free tools:**
- Google: search `"business name" "address"`
- Google: search `"phone number"`

**Paid tools:**
- Moz Local
- BrightLocal
- Semrush Listing Management
- Yext

### Step 3: Identify Inconsistencies

```text
Audit spreadsheet:
| Platform    | Name | Address | Phone | Status |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| GBP         | ✅   | ✅      | ✅    | OK     |
| Yelp        | ❌   | ✅      | ✅    | Fix    |
| Yellow Pages| ✅   | ❌      | ✅    | Fix    |
```

### Step 4: Correct

1. Claim listings
2. Manually update
3. Remove duplicates
4. Document access credentials

---

## Duplicate Management

### Detection

```text
Google searches:
- "Business name" + city
- Phone number in quotes
- Address in quotes
```

### Removal

| Platform | Procedure |
| --- | --- |
| Google | GBP > Report a problem > Duplicate |
| Yelp | Claim then merge |
| Facebook | Merge pages |
| Yellow Pages | Contact support |

---

## Structured vs Unstructured Citations

### Structured (Directories)
- Standard NAP format
- Categories, hours, photos
- **High priority**

### Unstructured (Mentions)
- Local blogs, press, partners
- Mention of name + city
- **SEO bonus** if linked

**Unstructured mention example:**
> "ABC Plumbing, located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, won the award..."
