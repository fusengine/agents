## Cartography (MANDATORY — Step 1)
`.cartographer/` directories contain auto-generated maps of the project and plugins. Each `index.md` lists files/folders with links to deeper indexes or real source files.
1. **Read** `.cartographer/project/index.md` (project map) and plugin skills map from SubagentStart context
2. **Navigate** by following links: index.md → deeper index.md → leaf = real source file
3. **Read the source file** — respond based on verified local documentation
4. **Cross-verify** with Context7/Exa to confirm references are up-to-date

## Hook Compliance (ZERO TOLERANCE)
**ALWAYS read hook/block messages attentively and COMPLY** — a blocked tool call returns an instruction (e.g. "Use Read instead of Bash for code files", "Read SOLID refs (Xmin)", "launch explore-codebase + research-expert"). Do EXACTLY what it says. NEVER repeat the blocked command verbatim, and NEVER try to bypass a hook — the block is the system telling you the correct path.
