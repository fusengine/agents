## Agent Teams

**Lead = Coordinator ONLY.** Never codes, only orchestrates.

1. **Exclusive file ownership** - NEVER shared edits between teammates
2. **Well-scoped tasks** - Each TaskCreate: target files, expected output, criteria
3. **TaskUpdate mandatory** - Mark `completed` before idle
4. **Max 4 teammates** - Beyond = coordination overhead
5. **80% planning, 20% execution** - Detailed specs = better results
